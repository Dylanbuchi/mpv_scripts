    Sets "PowerMizer" in Nvidia GPUs with the proprietary driver to
    "Maximum Performance" mode while mpv is running.
    Sets "PowerMizer" back to "Adaptive" after mpv exits.
    
    The script will try to automatically detect a GPU.
    
    You can also manually set your GPU like this: --script-opts=powermizer-gpu="[gpu:1]"
    Find your GPU with this command: nvidia-settings -q gpus
